    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would recomend the client to be aware that security attacks can happen in various methods. THey should use a secure authorization and authentication. Like OneLogin. Witch is hard to crack. And I would recomend running every chang made against a CI/CD integrating process, such as "github action" or "Circle CI". THe website should also have an implementation of automatic user timeout, whitch protects the users credebtials, if the user have been leaving their personal information in a form for to long</p>
